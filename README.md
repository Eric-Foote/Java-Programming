# Java-Programming

Currently the Practice Problem folder contains problems from programmingbydoing.com 
The oldJavaProjects folder contains problems that I worked on during the summer of 2017 from the textbook that I used in the intro java course that I took during the winter and summer of 2015
The projects folder contains bigger programming projects that I got from programmingbydoing.com
The examples folder contains examples
The data structures folder will contain work from the algorithms book that I used in my data structuresthat was used in the course
The codeWars Pratice Problems contains problems from codewars
Finally, the pratice problems2 folder contains some of problems from the intro to java course that was not covered in programmingbydoing

This folder is currently on hold as I am going to move on to the C Programming folder

I need to do the algorithms, the rest of programming by doing and the last few problems from the textbook from intro
