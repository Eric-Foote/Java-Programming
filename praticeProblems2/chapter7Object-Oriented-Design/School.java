/* Write a class called Course that represents a course taken at a school. Represent each student using
 * the modified Student class from the previous programming project. Use an ArrayList in the Course
 * class should accept only the name of the course. Provide a method called addStudent that accepts one
 * Student parameter. Provide a method called average that computes and returns the average of all
 * students' test score averages. Provide a method called roll that prints all the students in the
 * course. Create a driver class with a main method that creates a course, adds several students,
 * prints a roll, and prints the overall course test average. Modify the Student class presented
 * in the chapter as follows, Each student object should also contain the scores for three tests.
 * Provide a constructor that sets all instance values based on paramter values. Overload the 
 * constructor such that each test score is assumed to be initally zero. Provide a method called
 * setTestScore that accepts two parameters: the test number (1 through 3) and the score. Also 
 * provide a method called getTestScore that accepts the test number and returns the appropriate 
 * score. Provide a method called average that computes and returns the average test score for this
 * student. Modify the toString method such that teh test scores and average are included in the 
 * description of the student. Modify the driver class main method to exerciee the new Student
 * methods.
 * We are given some code to start with on pg.318
