This file here can not be run on java-11-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.6.10-0.fc31.x86_64/bin/java) 

I have to use java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.242.b08-0.fc31.x86_64/jre/bin/java)

to swich between them I need to use the following command

sudo update-alternatives --config java

It is option 1 instead of option 2!

Currently the issue is with the javax swing packages
